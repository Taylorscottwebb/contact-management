Introduction
Welcome to the Contact Management System project! In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills to create a functional command-line-based application that simplifies the management of your contacts. The Contact Management System will empower you to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts with ease, all while reinforcing your understanding of Python dictionaries, file handling, user interaction, and error handling.



Project Requirements
Your task is to develop a Contact Management System with the following features:

User Interface (UI):
Create a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Contact Management System.
Display a welcoming message and provide a menu with the following options:
``` Welcome to the Contact Management System! Menu:
Add a new contact
Edit an existing contact
Delete a contact
Search for a contact
Display all contacts
Export contacts to a text file
Import contacts from a text file *BONUS
Quit "> 
Contact Data Storage:
Use nested dictionaries as the main data structure for storing contact information.
Each contact should have a unique identifier (e.g., a phone number or email address) as the outer dictionary key.
Store contact details within the inner dictionary, including:
Name
Phone number
Email address
Additional information (e.g., address, notes).
Menu Actions:
Implement the following actions in response to menu selections:
Adding a new contact with all relevant details.
Editing an existing contact's information (name, phone number, email, etc.).
Deleting a contact by searching for their unique identifier.
Searching for a contact by their unique identifier and displaying their details.
Displaying a list of all contacts with their unique identifiers.
Exporting contacts to a text file in a structured format.
Importing contacts from a text file and adding them to the system. * BONUS
User Interaction:
Utilize input() to enable users to select menu options and provide contact details.
Implement input validation using regular expressions (regex) to ensure correct formatting of contact information.
Error Handling:
Apply error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage unexpected issues that may arise during execution.
GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Commit your code to the repository regularly.
Create a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository.
Include clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
Provide examples and screenshots, if possible, to enhance user understanding.
Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.
Optional Bonus Points
Contact Categories (Bonus): Implement the ability to categorize contacts into groups (e.g., friends, family, work). Each contact can belong to one or more categories.
Contact Search (Bonus): Enhance the contact search functionality to allow users to search for contacts by name, phone number, email address, or additional information.
Contact Sorting (Bonus): Implement sorting options to display contacts alphabetically by name or based on other criteria.
Backup and Restore (Bonus): Add features to create automatic backups of contact data and the ability to restore data from a backup file.
Custom Contact Fields (Bonus): Allow users to define custom fields for contacts (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries) and store this information.
Project Submission

Upon completion, submit your project, including all source code files and the README.md file in your GitHub repository, to your instructor or designated platform.
Project Tips

Begin by designing a simple, intuitive user interface that aligns with the provided menu options.
Test your code iteratively as you implement each feature to identify and address any potential bugs or issues.
Collaborate with fellow learners, seek assistance, and remember that learning is a collaborative effort.
By successfully completing this project, you will not only enhance your Python programming skills but also have a practical Contact Management System to streamline your contact management tasks. Get ready to create a valuable tool for yourself and others!

Happy coding! üìáüêç
